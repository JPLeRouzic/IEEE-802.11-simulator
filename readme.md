This simulator integrates three amendments to the famous standard: 802.11ac the current Wi-Fi, 802.11af a somewhat unknown protocol for using TV white spaces and the next Wi-Fi which will hit the market in 2018: 802.11ax. 

It uses the concepts and vocabulary of IEEE 802.11 study group. 

Finally this is a work in progress, now what the simulation produces is only an XML file, more will come later.
